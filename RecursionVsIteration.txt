Iteration and Recursion are the two methods of repeating a block of
code, despite the similarities in the outputs they generate, they
work differently. Iteration is the process of repeating some instructions
until some condition prevents the further repetitation while Recursion is
the continuous self calling of a function until a specific condition
called the 'Base Case' finally terminates this process. Generally from
the observations, it feels resonable to say that Iteration usually
outperforms the Recursion. This conclusion is made by considering
the following points about Recursion and Iteration:

Iteration:
1. Space complexity is usually lower.
2. Time complexity is better compared to Recursion.
3. There's no stack involved.
4. No intermediate data needs to be stored in a stack.
5. Needs to a function to be defined.
6. faster.

Recursion:
1. space complexity is usually higher.
2. time complexity is higher than that of Iteration.
3. stack is involved.
4. need to keep track of stack frames.
5. doens't need a function.
6. slower.
