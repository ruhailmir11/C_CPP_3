Recursive functions are the functions that call themselves,
recursive functions are typically used to solve the class of problems
that can be split into smaller sub problems, the solution is
obtained by ultimately combining the solutions from these sub problems.
Becase of the fact that these recursive functions divide the problems
into sub problems, there is a need of storing the results of
the previous executions into some data structure because the next
computation is dependent on this result. The data structure
that most fits this context is called the STACK. Whenever the function
calls itself it creates a new element in the STACK with the current
state of the function called a 'stack frame'. STACK is most suitable
because, it follows the LIFO order, so the calling functions easily
PUSH the state into the STACK and immediately POP when the
function returns.
